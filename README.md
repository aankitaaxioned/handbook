# PRDXN Employee Handbook

The first rule of PRDXN-Club: Is HANDBOOK FIRST!

The PRDXN team handbook is the central repository for how we run the company. As part of our value of being transparent the handbook is open to the world, and we welcome feedback. Please make a pull request to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Few sections of this handbook may not open to the world and is only accessible to employees.

Remote work is also what led to the development of our publicly viewable handbook, which captures everything you'd need to know about the company. If you can't tell, we like efficiency and don't like having to explain things twice.
