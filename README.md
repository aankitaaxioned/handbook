# PRDXN Employee Handbook

The PRDXN team handbook is the central repository for how we run the company. As part of our value of being transparent the handbook is open to the world, and we welcome feedback. Please make a pull request to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Few sections of this handbook may not open to the world and is only accessible to employees.

## Purpose (why we exist)
Our purpose and satisfaction comes from delighting our clients and seeing their businesses scale and grow as a result of our support and services.

## Mission Statement (what we do)
We‚Äôre biased towards action and getting things done; solving for industry-agnostic creative and technology challenges.

We start with the question: What would we/PRDXN do if your (Client‚Äôs) technology project was ours? We spend your (Client‚Äôs) time & money as though it were our own based on our 10+ years of experience in building & maintaining innovative technology solutions.

## Core Values
PRDXN's seven values are:
- WOW - clients and fellow team members
- Respect
- Proactiveness
- Ownership
- ü§ù Team Spirit
- Integrity
- üëÅÔ∏è Transparency

### About our values
We take inspiration from other companies, and we always go for the boring solutions. Just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our values and strive to make them better. PRDXN values are a living document. In many instances, they have been documented, refined, and revised based on lessons learned (and scars earned) in the course of doing business.

Everyone is welcome to suggest improvements.
