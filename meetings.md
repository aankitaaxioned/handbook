# How to do meetings

On this page, we're detailing how to optimize meetings, especially in remote environment.

## Make meetings optional
Anyone who has worked in a corporate environment has likely seen the sarcastic "I Survived Another Meeting That Should Have Been An Email" award. As an remote / office-optional company, we do not look to a meeting by default, and we strive to make meetings optional.

In many companies, meetings are used as a mechanism to create consensus. As you'll read in the Leadership portion of the handbook, we are not a democratic or consensus driven company. People are encouraged to give their comments and opinions, but in the end one person (based on Roles & Responsibility) decides the matter after they have listened to all the feedback.

You should aim to record minutues of all meetings, particularly when key individuals aren't able to join live. This allows team members to catch up on what transpired, adding context to notes that were taken during the meeting. 

## Have an agenda
If you determine that a meeting is needed to move a project forward, address a blocker, or resolve a miscommunication, be sure to have an agenda and be disciplined about using it.

- Create the agenda in a Google Doc ahead of time
- Ensure that the appropriate sharing settings are in place to prevent a chorus of "I can't access the agenda" comments
- Link the agenda in the meeting invite
- Establish the agenda as far in advance of the meeting as possible
- Agendas should be simple: numbered, bulleted lists that are concise and direct.
- Take notes inline with the agenda rather than using a seperate "notes" section
- Preface questions and answers with the participant's name, giving context to the origin
- Follow the order of the questions instead of jumping around in the agenda
- Always ask if the name preceding the question would like to verbalize; if they wish not to, or are otherwise unavailable, the meeting host should verbalize on their behalf
- Reenact questions in the list by verbalizing them even if they were already asked and answered in the shared document. Hearing the question and answer allows everyone to think about it and respond to it.

This accomplishes several things:
- It prevents knowledge leaks. Meetings without agendas are only useful to those in it, and even then, it's likely that outcomes will be forgotten, or critical pieces of the puzzle will become less familiar over time.
- It creates a more inclusive meeting atmopshere. People can add questions and insights before (and even after) a synchronous meeting. Plus, those who are less comfortable verbalizing points in front of management can use the agenda doc to properly articulate their complete thoughts.
- It creates a takeaway. The agenda doc lives longer after the meeting. If you want to share it further, perhaps sending to a person or team that you realize would have benefitted from attending, you're able to do so.
- It shifts the memorization burden away from humans. If there's an agenda doc affixed to each calendar invite, you can easily search your calendar for key words (marketing, CEO, engineering, etc.), find a given meeting, and immediately access a documented history of what was discussed.

> Many meetings can be avoided by understanding how to work well asynchronously but not all meetings are inherently bad. We encourage managers to establish regular 1:1 meetings with their team, for example.
