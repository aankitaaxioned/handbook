# How to do meetings

On this page, we're detailing how to optimize meetings, especially in remote environment.

## Make meetings optional
Anyone who has worked in a corporate environment has likely seen the sarcastic "I Survived Another Meeting That Should Have Been An Email" award. As an remote / office-optional company, we do not look to a meeting by default, and we strive to make meetings optional.

In many companies, meetings are used as a mechanism to create consensus. As you'll read in the Leadership portion of the handbook, we are not a democratic or consensus driven company. People are encouraged to give their comments and opinions, but in the end one person (based on Roles & Responsibility) decides the matter after they have listened to all the feedback.

You should aim to record minutues of all meetings, particularly when key individuals aren't able to join live. This allows team members to catch up on what transpired, adding context to notes that were taken during the meeting. 

## Have an agenda
If you determine that a meeting is needed to move a project forward, address a blocker, or resolve a miscommunication, be sure to have an agenda and be disciplined about using it.

- Create the agenda in a Google Doc ahead of time
- Ensure that the appropriate sharing settings are in place to prevent a chorus of "I can't access the agenda" comments
- Link the agenda in the meeting invite
- Establish the agenda as far in advance of the meeting as possible
- Agendas should be simple: numbered, bulleted lists that are concise and direct.
- Take notes inline with the agenda rather than using a seperate "notes" section
- Preface questions and answers with the participant's name, giving context to the origin
- Follow the order of the questions instead of jumping around in the agenda
- Always ask if the name preceding the question would like to verbalize; if they wish not to, or are otherwise unavailable, the meeting host should verbalize on their behalf
- Reenact questions in the list by verbalizing them even if they were already asked and answered in the shared document. Hearing the question and answer allows everyone to think about it and respond to it.

This accomplishes several things:
- It prevents knowledge leaks. Meetings without agendas are only useful to those in it, and even then, it's likely that outcomes will be forgotten, or critical pieces of the puzzle will become less familiar over time.
- It creates a more inclusive meeting atmopshere. People can add questions and insights before (and even after) a synchronous meeting. Plus, those who are less comfortable verbalizing points in front of management can use the agenda doc to properly articulate their complete thoughts.
- It creates a takeaway. The agenda doc lives longer after the meeting. If you want to share it further, perhaps sending to a person or team that you realize would have benefitted from attending, you're able to do so.
- It shifts the memorization burden away from humans. If there's an agenda doc affixed to each calendar invite, you can easily search your calendar for key words (marketing, CEO, engineering, etc.), find a given meeting, and immediately access a documented history of what was discussed.

> Many meetings can be avoided by understanding how to work well asynchronously but not all meetings are inherently bad. We encourage managers to establish regular 1:1 meetings with their team, for example. 

## Document everything live (yes, everything)
It's not rude to focus on documentation in a meeting. A surefire way to waste time in a meeting is to avoid writing anything down. Meetings within an remote company require documentation to be worthwhile.

## Cancel unnecessary recurring meetings
Recurring meetings are oftentimes established as meaningful points along a given a journey. Don't hesitate to cancel them after their purpose has been served. Cancelling meetings isn't a slight to those on the invite list. In fact, ridding multiple calendars of a meeting should be celebrated and conjure a sense of liberation.

## Meetings are about the work, not the background

One's appearance, surroundings, and background can be the source of great stress and anxiety when preparing for a video call. At GitLab, we encourage team members to bring their whole selves to work.

- Don't waste time trying to find the perfect backdrop for your video call.
- Celebrate unique surroundings. It's not uncommon to see GitLab team members participate in a video call from the shores of a lake, coffee shops, RVs, or even while walking.
- Focus on your internet connection and your audio quality (use headphones), reducing listening fatigue for others.
- Encourage others to say hello! All remote employees invite others into their homes via video call, creating a unique opportunity to share their lives with colleagues.

## Start on time, end on time
A nontrivial amount of time is required to regain focus on a task following a distraction. While it is not always possible to schedule meetings such that they do not break up the flow of an ongoing project, it's important to begin and end meetings on time as to minimize disruption.

When scheduling a meeting we value people's time and prefer the "speedy meetings" setting in our Google Calendar. This gives us meetings of, for example, 25 or 50 minutes leaving some time to write notes, stretch, etc. before continuing to our next call or meeting. (This setting can be found under the calendar Settings menu at "default event duration"). 

## It's OK to look away
We empower team members to be the manager of their attention.

- It's completely acceptable to work on other tasks if (a particular portion of) a meeting doesn't apply to you. If your meeting is with only PRDXN team members please leave your camera on to allow people to see the overall interest level and adjust the time spent on certain topics.
- It's not embarrassing to ask occasionally for something to be repeated. Because you manage your own attention, you are free to engage with other work and then be pulled back into a relevant part of the meeting conversation.
- It feels rude in video calls to interrupt people. This is because the latency causes you to talk over the speaker for longer than during an in-person meeting. We should not be discouraged by this, the questions and context provided by interruptions are valuable. This is a situation where we have to do something counter-intuitive to make all-remote meetings work. Everyone is encouraged to interrupt the speaker in a video call to ask a question or offer context. We want everyone to contribute instead of a monologue. Just like in-person meetings be cognizant of when, who, and how you interrupt, we don't want manterrupting.
