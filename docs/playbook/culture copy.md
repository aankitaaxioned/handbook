## Overview

When we use the expression `Axioned’s Core Values` we mean: the behaviours, attitudes and standards we would like each and everyone of us to:

- Value in our colleagues
- Use as our “guiding light” for how we should behave and operate in the Axioned workplace/with others
- Compare ourselves against, at all times, no matter how Junior and/or Senior we may be

The dictionary definition of `values` that we’re referring to here is:

> “principles or standards of behaviour; one's judgement of what is important in life.”

Synonyms:

> principles, moral principles, ethics, moral code, morals, moral values, standards, moral standards, code of behaviour, rules of conduct, standards of behaviour.

###

## Respect

> We respect our work & the people we work with.

- Respect your role. Respect your work. Respect your clients and team-mates.
- Do you know what’s expected of you? Do you ask questions? Do you know why you’re doing what you’re doing? Do you know why your peers/manager(s)/client(s) have these expectations? Have you taken the time to find out why? Knowing why you’re doing what you’re doing is a sign of respect for your role, your work, your clients, and your team-mates.
- Do you do your role/work, well? As measured by who? As exemplified by what actions/outputs? Do you know? Have you asked? Be curious/ask questions and solicit feedback (team mates, managers, clients). Use such exchanges to learn and grow. Taking ownership of your own learning and growth path is a sign of respect for your role and your work - and (most importantly), yourself.
- Respect everyone’s differences: Treat each person with the same respect that you yourself would like to be treated, no matter how different they are from you, in terms of how they look, speak, think, act, etc. (This is often referred to as "The Golden Rule".)
- Respect other people’s ideas and expressions: Listen to other's questions, answers, ideas, opinions, and advice with an open mind, even if you already know the answer or don't agree with them. Show respect by giving them the benefit of “hearing them out”. Know that when someone is communicating with you ensure that THEY can clearly observe that you respect what they have to say through your facial movements (or lack of), body language and communication skills.
- Be mindful of your words: Words can be very powerful. Words can be incredibly disrespectful if used improperly. Words can also be incredibly respectful if used properly. Think carefully about what you want to say, and to whom. Avoid being disrespectful. Aim to always be respectful. Good manners matter.

## Teamwork

> We collaborate with others to understand the “why?” behind our work and to get the work done.

**T.E.A.M. = Together, everyone achieves more.**

- Work effectively with fellow team mates, from all areas of the Company, to accomplish common objectives → aka cooperate.
- Motivate others to meet mutual goals and objectives via personal relationships vs. authority (force).
- Listen to, acknowledge and celebrate each team-mate early and often.
- Keep morale high: Team members function best when their individual contributions to the team are recognized. This, in turn, leads to a strengthening of the team spirit among its individual members.
- Keep communication lines open: Encourage frank and open communication among team members and management. Solicit ideas and suggestions from team members on ways to better achieve the team’s goals.

## Ownership

> We **never** pass the buck\*

_\* pass the buck = shift the responsibility for something to someone else._

- In absence of authority - step-up and take charge/move things forward without waiting to be asked.
- Proactively identify and take charge of clearing any dependencies - again, without waiting/asking.
- Remain highly adaptable and accepting of constant challenges and changes.
- Take ownership of our customers’ needs and being accountable for delivering the work/services we’ve agreed to do.
- Share the work of colleagues and take joint ownership to complete it/ensure that the team delivers.
- Know the in’s and outs of your project/work schedule. Know when something needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and why it needs to be done by a certain date. Own that schedule. Deliver ahead of schedule, or at least “on” schedule.
