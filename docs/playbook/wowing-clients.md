## Why WOW?

- What does it mean to WOW a client? See HOW TO WOW: Give customers what they want/expect
- WOW’ing clients helps us grow; both as a company and as individuals
- When we WOW, we “secure” business, aka revenues, which we can then utilize to re-invest in our team/co. Investing in our team/co. helps us further WOW our clients
- WOW’ing clients requires consistency; we need to do ALL the things required to WOW our clients and team-mates alike, consistently
- When we make efforts to WOW a client, we need to ensure we’re not doing things/taking actions that are at the cost of other critical things “falling down”. E.g. WOW’ing ONE client at the cost of not WOW’ing ANOTHER client = NOT desirable.

## How to WOW: Give customers what they want/expect

Customers (and teammates) expect/want:

1. **Human interactions** - with human-levels of empathy. And we pick-up the phone/get on a Zoom call to talk through things that would benefit from being talked through; especially complicated or difficult things.
2. **Easy interactions** - we’re easy to work with/communicate with
3. **Fast service** - we deliver on or (ideally) before the timelines we promise (to do this, we add buffer to our estimates/communications with clients, but as a team stick to tighter timelines/commitments internally)
4. Supportive interactions - We understand who our client is, what they want, why they want it, when they want it, where they want it, and how they want it (5Ws+1H); and we align ourselves, our team, and the service/work we’re delivering, to those 5Ws+1H
5. **Clear information** - We communicate our expectations/wants/needs of our clients clearly and concisely. We revise these communications as/when we see opportunities to make things even simpler/easier for our clients to understand and follow.
