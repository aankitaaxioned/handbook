The Organisation Chart can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wQs3MEl2fUr-GEWV883hGiz7RYt0XqiQeAgY6ZUvbIM/edit#gid=2144082336).

In addition to the Organisation chart/the team we have in India, we have a network of trusted partners/freelancers that we work with for design/build. We’re also supported by David Simpson who supports Biz Dev activities in the USA & London/Europe.

What’s the vision for our future org chart? Email Libby and Anurag, if interested!
