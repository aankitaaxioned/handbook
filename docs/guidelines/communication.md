It's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently. To accomplish this, we use **asynchronous communication as a starting point** and stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating through Slack / MS Teams channels, Zoho Projects, Github issues / merge requests and emails. We also place an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down. When we go **back and forth three times,** we jump on a synchronous video call.

We communicate respectfully and professionally at all times.

## Effective & Responsible Communication Guidelines

1. **Assume Positive Intent.** Always being with a position of positivity and grace.
2. **Kindness Matters.** You are looking at a screen, but you are really talking to a person. If you wouldn't say it to a person's face, don't send it to them in a text message.
3. **Express Your Thoughts.** We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things.
4. **Own It.** If you say it or type it, own it. If it hurts the company or an individual, even unintentionally, we encourage you to look at things from other points of view and apologize easily.
5. **Be a Role Model of our Values.**
6. **Feedback is Essential.** It is difficult to know what is appropriate in every one of our team members 60+ countries. We encourage team members to give feedback and receive feedback in a considerate way.
7. **Don't Underestimate a 1:1.** Asynchronous communication (e.g., via text) is helpful and necessary. In some cases (e.g., to clarify misunderstandings) it can be much more effective to jump on a Zoom video call.
8. **Always Adhere to our Anti-Harassment Policy and Code of Conduct.** Everyone should be comfortable in their work environment.

## Everyone is a Moderator

If you see something that concerns you in Slack, Issues, Merge Requests, Video, Emails or any other forum, we encourage you to respectfully say something directly to the individual in a 1:1 format. If you are not comfortable reaching out to the individual directly, please reach out to your direct manager or People Business Partner to discuss.

## External communication
There are 8 key practices to consider during any meeting. They are the following:

1. **Video Calls** - If this is your first time meeting a customer/prospect/partner/etc., turn on your camera when you login to Zoom. This will help to make the customer/prospect feel more comfortable as they are certain your undivided attention is geared towards them.
2. **Agenda** - Always have an agenda prepped and ready to go. Share this with your audience. Make sure that everything on the agenda is accurate and ask if there’s anything missing that needs to be addressed during this call or for the future. When there is no agenda, it translates to you not caring.
3. **70/30 Rule** - Ask open ended questions that leave the audience talking 70% of the time, while you are talking 30% of the time. Please note that this varies based on the type of meeting that you are conducting. Be conscious of what questions needs to be asked and to capture those items.
4. **Take Notes** - Effective note-taking is a valuable skill that will help you retain and recall any important details. Be the person who remembers all the details of your audience's needs.
5. **Adapt to Audience Tone** - Before going into the business portion of your meeting, evaluate first the tone of the audience. Adapt your tone accordingly in order to appeal to various types of personalities.
6. **Mid-call** - Half-way through the meeting, check in with your audience. Ask them what their thoughts are on the progression of this meeting and if what you're presenting is on the right track. This helps both you and the audience by re-aligning expectations and making sure the meeting is going the right direction. 
7. **Pre-Close Summary** - 10 Minutes (1-hour meetings) or 5 minutes (30 minute meetings) prior to ending the call, ask the audience to build out an agenda for the next step or meeting. This helps to secure next steps and to ensure there are no balls dropped.
8. **Post Meeting Action** - Immediately write down notes and next steps and input into proper directory (Google Drive, Salesforce, etc.).
9. **Two Block Rule** - For in person meetings with external parties you should wait until you're more than two blocks from the meeting before discussing the results of the meeting. Nobody wants to hear themselves being discussed in the bathroom.

## Internal Communication
1. Use asynchronous communication when possible: merge requests (preferred) or issues. Announcements happen on the appropriate slack channels and people should be able to do their work without getting interrupted by chat.
2. You are not expected to be available all the time. There is no expectation to respond to messages outside of your planned working hours.
3. Sometimes synchronous communication is the better option, but do not default to it. For example, a video call can clear things up quickly when you are blocked.
4. If you mention something (a merge request, issue, commit, webpage, comment, etc.) please include a link to it.
5. All company data should be shareable with the appropriate target audience (project team, department, etc) by default. Don't use a local text file or Google docs which are in your personal drive.
6. When someone asks something, give back a deadline or that you did it. Answers like: 'will do', 'OK', 'it is on my todo list' are not helpful. If it is small it's better to spend 2 minutes and do the tasks so the other person can mentally forget about it. If it is large you need to figure out when you'll do it, by returning that information the other person might decide to solve it in another way if it takes too long.
7. It is OK to bring an issue to someone's attention with a CC ("cc @user"), but CCs alone are not enough if specific action is needed from someone. The mentioned user may read the issue and take no further action. If you need something, please explicitly communicate your need along with @ mentioning who you need it from.
8. Avoid creating private groups for internal discussions:
    - It's disturbing (all users in the group get notified for each message).
    - It's not searchable.
    - It's not shareable: there is no way to add people in the group (and this often leads to multiple groups creation).
    - They don't have a subject, so everyone has to remember the topic of each private group based on the participants, or open the group again to read the content.
    - History is lost when leaving the group.
9. Use low-context communications by being explicit in your communications. We are a remote-only company, located all over the world. Provide as much context as possible to avoid confusion. Relatedly, we use ubiquitous language for communication efficiency.
10. When discussing concepts, be careful not to lean too much into hypotheticals. There is a tipping point in which it decreases value and no longer becomes constructive at helping everyone come into a unified decision.


## How to make a Companywide Announcement
1. Consider the subject and the audience. Questions you might want to ask yourself; is this relevant to all team members globally? is this something important, urgent and high priority? is there a better place for this communication, such as a more informal slack channel?
2. Keep it simple, brief and summarize what is important. Cover the 5 W's. What, Why, Who, When, Where (you can also add How, if required as a call to action).
3. Common companywide announcements include (but are not limited to): organization changes, policy iterations, requests to participate in a company survey, process improvement and security/safety announcements.

## Not Public

The following items are not public by default:

1. Security vulnerabilities are not public since it would allow attackers to compromise GitLab installations. We do make them public after we remediated a vulnerability. Issues that discuss how to improve upon the security posture of an implementation that is working as intended can be made public, and are often labeled as feature proposals. Security implementations that detect malicious activities cannot be made public because doing so would undermine our operations.
2. Financial information, including revenue and costs for the company, is confidential 
3. Content that would violate confidentiality for a PRDXN team member, customer, or user.
4. Some information is kept confidential by the People Group to protect the privacy, safety, and security of team members and applicants, including applications, background check reports, reference checks, compensation, termination (voluntary and involuntary) details, demographic information, and home address. 
5. Performance improvement plans, disciplinary actions, as well as individual feedback, are confidential as they contain private feedback between team members and managers.
6. Customer information is not public since customers are not comfortable with that, and it would make it easier for competitors to approach our customers. If an issue needs to contain any specific information about a customer, including but not limited to company name, employee names, number of users, the issue should be made confidential. 
7. Competitive sales and marketing campaign planning is confidential since we want the minimize the time the competition has to respond to it.
8. Plans for reorganizations are not public and on a need-to-know basis within the organization. Reorganizations cause disruption and the plans tend to change a lot before being finalized, so being public about them prolongs the disruption. We will keep relevant team members informed whenever possible.
9. If public information compromises the physical safety of one or more team members, it will be made not public because creating a safe, inclusive environment for team members is important to how we work. Information that might compromise the physical safety of a team member includes doxxing or threats made against a team member.

## Effective Communication Competency

**Skills and behavior of applying effective communication as a Team Member:**
- Effectively practices communication via text.
- Uses asynchronous communication when possible: Status Updates threads, Zoho Projects, Github Issues or merge requests
- Directs all communication to the appropiate channels (Slack/MS Teams, GitLab, email).
- Recognises when synchronous communication is the more appropriate option.
- Practices low context communication and provides as much background as possible when communicating via text to avoid confusion.

**Skills and behavior of applying effective communication as a People Manager:**

- Implements working asynchronously across teams, departments or across the company. Drives communication where possible to asynchronous channels.
- Holds team members accountable for effectively communicating via text.
- Fosters an environment across teams, departments or divisions where asynchronous communication is the starting point.
- Drives and funnels conversations to the right channels across teams, divisions and the company.

## Communicate directly
When working on a problem or issue, communicate directly with the people you need support from rather than working through reporting lines. Direct communication with the people you need to collaborate with is more efficient than working through your manager, their manager, or another intermediary. Escalate to management if you are not getting the support you need. Remember that everyone is a manager of one and they might have to complete their own assignments and inform the reporting lines.

## Take a Break Call

- Take a Break Calls happen every Tuesday. These calls have 5 predetermined topics for team members to choose from. You can find the topics listed in the invite, as well as the link for that topic. These calls are not mandatory, but are a great way to get to know your fellow team members.
- Every Friday we have an AMA with an executive to talk about anything the people at our company are thinking about.
- Everyone at GitLab is invited to the Take A Break Call.
- We use Zoom, (please be sure to mute your microphone when not speaking). If using the Zoom web app, you can go to settings and check always mute microphone when joining a meeting.
- We start on time and do not wait for people.
- These calls are unstructured to allow for natural interaction, but everyone should get a chance to share at least once.
- It helps to pause slightly between talking about different topics to allow for discussion.
- If you are unsure of who should start or speak next, follow the order listed in Zoom.

Some Topics for Calls:
- Hobbies and interests.
- What you've been up to recently.
- Things you're looking forward to.
- Sports and wellness.
- Cooking, entertaining, and creative projects.
- Travel, kids, family, and pets.
- Music, books, TV & movies, and video/board games.

## Random
The [#random](https://prdxn.slack.com/archives/C015YSRNPT4) Slack channel is your go-to place to share random ideas, pictures, articles, and more. It's a great channel to check out when you need a mental break.

## Scheduling Meetings

1. If you want to ask GitLab team members if they are available for an event please send a calendar invite. When you add a GitLab team member as a “Guest” in Google Calendar, you can click the See Guest Availability button to check availability and find a time on their calendar. These calendar invites will automatically show up on all parties calendars even when the email is not opened. It is an easier way to ensure everyone has visibility to the meeting and member’s status. Please respond quickly to invites so people can make necessary plans.
2. Every scheduled meeting should either have a Google Presentation (for example for functional updates that don't require participation) or a Google Doc (for most meetings) linked. If it is a Google Doc it should have an agenda, including any preparation materials (can be a presentation). Put the agenda in a Google Doc that has edits rights for all participants (including people not part of GitLab Inc.). Link the Google Doc from the meeting invite. Take notes of the points and todos during the meeting. Nobody wants to write up a meeting after the fact and this helps to structure the thought process and everyone can contribute. Being able to structure conclusions and follow up actions in realtime makes a video call more effective than an in-person meeting. If it is important enough to schedule a meeting it is important enough to have a Doc linked. If we want to be on the same page we should be looking at that page.
3. When scheduling a call with multiple people, invite them using a Google Calendar that is your own, or one specific to the people joining, so the calendar item doesn't unnecessarily appear on other people's calendars.
4. Please click 'Guests can modify event' so people can update the time in the calendar instead of having to reach out via other channels. You can configure this to be checked by default under Event Settings.)
5. When scheduling a meeting we value people's time and prefer the "speedy meetings" setting in our Google Calendar. This gives us meetings of, for example, 25 or 50 minutes leaving some time to:
    - Write notes and reflect
    - Respond to urgent messages
    - Take a bio break
    - Stretch your legs
    - Grab a snack
6. When scheduling a meeting, please try to have it start at :00 (hour) or :30 (mid-hour) to leave common start times available for other meetings on your attendees' calendars. Meetings should be for the time needed, so if you need 15 minutes just book that.
When creating a calendar event that will be used company wide, please place it on the GitLab Team Meetings Calendar. That way the event is easily located by all individuals.
7. When you need to cancel a meeting, make sure to delete/decline the meeting and choose the option Decline & update guests to make sure everyone knows you can't attend and don't wait for you.
