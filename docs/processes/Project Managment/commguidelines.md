## Answer the 5 W and 1 H for your project

- **Why** - The reason why the project or a task is being undertaken in terms of the issue, problem and/or opportunity. Client’s perspective.
- **What** - From this question, identify the scope, project high-level key outputs that will need to deliver, and activities that it will undertake.
- **Who** - Use this question to identify the stakeholders, explore the list of the members of the project team, this includes, for example, all members of the client team, details of vendor representatives, and other staff assigned to provide support for the project
- **Where**- Try to identify where will the project be done and where will it be delivered.
- **When** - Use this question to determine the project due dates, it will help you to provide a high-level overview of the project timeline.
- **How**- Identifying how it will be done. Break down of deliverables, identifying development approaches, check quality method, checklists etc.

A Project Manager and the team should always be clear with each of these 5W and 1H about any project that they are working on - internal or external.

## General tips for writing effective emails

- Get Grammar and spelling right. Use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/). They have a Chrome extension.
- Brief subject lines
- Use bullets in email content to make your content more readable
- Try and logically divide the email into smaller sections and have a bold heading for each section.
- Highlighting issues
  - Always highlight key issues with either making the text bold or highlight in color.
  - When mentioning an issue in the email always mention the impact it has on the project or task.
  - It is good to be proactive and also mention the different solutions for the highlighted issue.
  - It is always good to talk to the person before sending a controversial or surprising email.
- Wait for sometime before sending an email
  - This is applicable when you are sending an escalation or a complaint.
  - Always avoid sending emails when you are angry or annoyed with something.
  - Include a picture or snapshot when possible.
- Document all the assumptions
  - Make sure you document all the assumptions you have made when sending the email.
  - This is especially true when you publish project plans or key project dates.
  - Clearly, state all the assumptions under a single heading like "Assumptions" at the end of the email.
- When sending an email to which you need a response make sure you give an accurate date and time by which you need a response.
- Always read your emails before hitting the send button.

## Acknowledging Emails

### Why to acknowledge:

- When people send email, they wish to receive a reply or acknowledgement, or else they get unsure whether their email has been received and read by the recipient or not.
- Acknowledgment re-assures the sender that not only has the email been successfully sent, but that you are aware of its contents. This shifts responsibility from the sender to the recipient .
- If an acknowledgement email is sent quickly, it suggests that as a recipient, you are both available and quick in managing requests, thus nurturing trust between both parties.
- Acknowledgment lets the email sender know that his or her request has already begun to be processed, even if you are not actually in a position to provide an ETA [Estimated Time of Arrival] in your email.
- This can actually gain you time overall as it re-assures the sender that the appropriate parties have been made aware of the request, and that no concerns have yet been raised.

### Ideal time to acknowledge:

- Such emails should be sent quickly. You may wish to respond within 1 to 24 hours. A good rule of thumb is to respond on the same day as the initial request.
- At PRDXN as we work across different time zones the following may work best for us:
  - Any email hitting the inbox between 11 am till 9 pm IST will be acknowledged within 2 hr of receipt.
  - Any email hitting the inbox after 9 pm IST will be acknowledged before 1 pm the following day.
    - The time frame is an indicator. PMs should be able to make smart decisions on what to prioritize when, keeping in mind that we don't keep the client waiting for long so as to make him ask for an update.

### What the acknowledgement email should consist of:

- The acknowledgment email should set expectation re next steps/timeline even if you are not in position to commit to an actual ETA (ie. “I’ll get back to you by today evening EST”).
- If you are not in a position to read the email thoroughly before sending an acknowledgment, it is absolutely acceptable to indicate this with a message of the type “Well received. [Our team / I] will review this carefully as soon as possible and circle back with any questions.”
- Follow up on the request in a timely manner, even if it’s only to provide an update or a firmer ETA. The acknowledgement email will lose all value over time if you do not back it up with actual content. Make it your aim to follow up with the sender before he or she has a chance to follow up with you on the request.

## Decision making

1. **Project Managers need to fully-own the decisions that they're making.** They need to question/test themselves on the decisions that they're making/recommending: 5Ws+1Hws; including testing their own decision against the Client/PRDXN Agreement language, through the perspective of the client, etc.
2. Seema, as the Manager of all Project Managers, needs to be able to fully back the decisions a PM is recommending, In order to do this, she needs to question/test the PM on the decisions that they're making/recommending: 5Ws+1Hws; including testing the PMs decision against the Client/PRDXN Agreement language, through the perspective of the client, etc. If Seema disagrees with the PMs decision on something, then that needs to be figured out by/between the PM and Seema.
3. If Seema and the PM are not 101% confident in their decision or "confused" about their decision, and are seeking further inputs/guidance, then they need to schedule time with whomever they feel they need guidance from - e.g. me/Anurag or Libby - to gather inputs. But BOTH - Seema and the PM - must be prepared to be questioned/"tested" by them. And know that Anurag/Libby (or whomever is being asked to provide inputs) will test them on the 5Ws+1H that need to have been considered already/in steps #1 and #2.

## Establish communication plan for your project

- Identify your stakeholders - to **whom** project communication needs to be sent.
- Identify stakeholder expectations - **why** to send communication.
- Identify communication necessary to satisfy stakeholder expectations and keep them informed - **what** needs to be communicated.

  - MoMs for all synchronous meetings.
  - Share Plan/Timeline once the planning phase is complete.
  - Regular status updates during the execution phase.
  - Phase completion report/email after each phase completion.
  - Project closure report/email at the end of the project.
