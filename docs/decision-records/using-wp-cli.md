title: (Example) Using WP-CLI
---

We should be using [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/), which is the command-line interface for WordPress that allows you to update plugins, export/import data/databases between instances, configure the site, and [much more](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/), without using a web browser. By adopting this, we can reliably automate many manual yet important activities which are otherwise time-consuming or could be error-prone.

## Decision Drivers

- {decision driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
- {decision driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
- … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

- {title of option 1}
- {title of option 2}
- {title of option 3}
- … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because
{justification. e.g., the only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.
