# Handbook

Welcome to this mixture of our working methodology, guidelines, useful resources and whatever we might decide to include here.

> The handbook is a living thing. It isn't ready, and it will never be.

The first rule of Axioned-club: Handbook First!

The Axioned team handbook is the central repository for how we run the company. It offers us an opportunity to clarify who we actually are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable. Making the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t articulated.

So many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they actually do. That’s a sham. Let’s not write a handbook like that. Let’s keep it honest.

As part of our value of being transparent the handbook is open to the world, and we welcome feedback. Please make a pull request to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Few sections of this handbook may not open to the world and is only accessible to employees.

Remote work is also what led to the development of our publicly viewable handbook, which captures everything you'd need to know about the company. If you can't tell, we like efficiency and don't like having to explain things twice.
