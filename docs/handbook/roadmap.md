## Introduction
This page will be for documenting and sharing plans for the handbook in true PRDXN fashion: iteratively and transparently. Like the handbook overall, this roadmap will always be a work in progressâ€”a living document.

Everyone is welcome to browse and contribute to our open handbook issues. If there's something you'd like to report or something you'd like to see on this roadmap then please don't hesitate to open a new issue. Contributions are welcome and appreciated!

## Ongoing work
- Migrating all 
- Small improvements such as link updates and text tweaks are constantly being made, but small changes can be made as quickly as updating the roadmap, so they don't need to be mentioned here unless they are part of a larger effort.

## Larger efforts
- Finish migration of all process documentations from Google Drive to Github.

## Refactoring
This section is a stub. It will be expanded soon.
