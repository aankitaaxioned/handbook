# Asking for help

> "You need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who don't cooperate."

The CEO of The Lego Group, Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, has a great way to use it. He says, **blame is not for failure, it is for failing to help or ask for help.**

## Who should escalate?
- This may/may not be the PM. 
  - E.g. On Crains/AdAge QA-only project, it will be the single QA resource assigned. 
  - E.g. On TimesPro, it will be whoever is primarily managing the Client Communications. 
  - E.g. On ADB, it will be whoever is primarily managing the Client Communications.
- Anyone who performs any type of inspection/audit/review and feels that theres a concern that needs escalation; independent of department/role/seniority also.
