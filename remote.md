# Working Remotely

##  What remote work promotes:
- Flexible working hours over set working hours.
- Writing down and recording knowledge over verbal explanations.
- Written down processes over on-the-job training.
- Public sharing of information over need-to-know access.
- Opening up every document for editing by anyone over top-down control of documents.
- Asynchronous communication over synchronous communication.
- The results of work over the hours put in.
- Formal communication channels over informal communication channels.

## How to adapt to work-from-home

### Must-do
- Daily Standups are highly recommended and mandatory for all projects, and should happen at the start of the day (ideally before 1 pm IST).
- Post your priorities in your respective project channel (before, if you know already, or right after the daily stand up).
  - Capture your today's availability/bandwidth/assignments on the respective *resourcing* channels.
  - If you have bandwidth available outside of the projects formally assigned to you, drop a note on `resourcing-ltd` channel for broader visibility.
- At the end of the day, put an update on your project channel capturing your progress/completion against the priorities established at the start of the day.
- Ensure you update Zoho daily with your project/task assignments and time logs.
- Drop a note on the project channel(s) if you are stepping away for a while or would be unavailable for time period.
- If you are facing technical issues (electricity/internet/hardware), notify your project team with the note and an ETA (to the best of your ability/understanding) and escalate to the IT team for support.

## Guide to Remote Work

### Carve out a dedicated workspace (achieving focus)
Where you work is as important as what you work on and who you work with. If you're able to use a dedicated space or room purely for work, that is ideal. If not, even a simple curtain to block off a place of work may usher you into a place of focus. The execution of this will look different depending on your home, and who all is in the domicile during your working hours, but the key is to find a space that is purely for work.

### Separate work from life (preventing burnout)
When there's no physical office to leave from, it's tempting to work longer than is expected (or healthy). If useful, set reminders to begin and end work, and pre-plan activities to fill the void where a commute once stood. Proactively planning what you'll do with your commute time is key to ramping into a workday and ramping off. This will look different for each individual, but leaving your home for a walk or a planned activity with friends/community is a great way to create unmistakable separation.

### Don't stop engaging with people (avoiding loneliness)
When there is no office to influence spontaneous informal communication, you must be intentional about weaving it into your day.

- Schedule regular coffee chats with people using a video call.
- Experiment with video-based chat tools. Create an always-on video conferencing room that your team can work from. (And remember, in a remote setting, [it's OK to look away!](https://github.com/prdxn-org/handbook/blob/master/meetings.md#its-ok-to-look-away))
- Talk about what you normally would. If sports, vacation plans, and hilarious tales of insubordination by children are common water-cooler material, work with your team to establish a chat channel to discuss things outside of work. The medium may be different, but the connection is the same.
- Experiment with video-based chat tools. Drop any shame or embarrassment. Everyone is in the same boat — a forced work-from-home arrangement with no preparation. Don't worry about your background, and feel welcome to let your pets and family find their way into calls on occasion. It humanizes the experience and reminds everyone that we're people first, and colleagues second.
- Connect with family and community. Working from home gives you an opportunity to spend time with a different set of people than just your coworkers. Look for opportunities to build bonds with family and community, which may have been impossible or limited when you had a commute.

### Respect the routine, but experiment with change (finding structure)
While embracing asynchronous workflows is a significant benefit of an all-remote team, temporary work-from-home arrangements may be less amenable to massive swings in time zone adoption. If this is the case, it's wise to formulate a routine that closely aligns with your prior routine. As mentioned above, the key is proactively filling the space that once held your commute. Aim for using this time to make yourself healthier. Exercising, resting, bonding with family, cooking, reading, studying, etc. — all great options. If you aren't careful, that time can be squandered and the lines between sleeping and working are blurred.

However, do not feel beholden to a routine. A perk of remote is the ability to experiment with unconventional working days. It's understood that not everyone shares the same peak hours of energy and focus. If you feel that you work best in late evenings, for example, have that conversation with your team and experiment with a non-linear workday, a term that describes the splicing of life and work in a deliberate stop-and-start fashion to maximize one's quality of life and work.

### Roll with the changes (embracing iteration)
Relax: you aren't born knowing how to work from home. Remember that transitioning to remote, even if temporary, is a process. You cannot copy an in-office environment and paste it into a remote one and expect everyone to function as usual.

It's important to overcommunicate with your team as you adjust. Speak up about issues. Offer solutions for communication gaps. Seek advice on how others have carved out dedicated places of work within their home. Crowdsource advice from within your organization. Look for opportunity in the midst of what will likely feel like a chaotic and destabilized situation. Remote is a chance to rethink how you live and work, and though it may sound counterintuitive, unleashing your imagination to take advantage of your new working reality may lead to long-term efficiencies.

## Tips
Arguably the biggest advantage of working remotely and asynchronously is the flexibility it provides. This makes it easy to combine work with your personal life, although it might be difficult to find the right balance.

### Find your routine
- You may work better with a consistent workday routine, or you may find that it's best to determine when your waves of peak productivity are, and design your work day and routine around them. These may shift and change depending on the season, holidays, family schedules, etc.
- Take small breaks throughout your working hours to keep your creativity or productivity going.
- If you worked at an office before, you might be missing your default group of coworkers at lunch. Now that you have the flexibility to choose what you do with that time, reach out to a friend and ask them to lunch (even virtually, why not?). Or spend that time with your family while you have the meal.

### Balance work and life
- Explicitly plan your time off so that you'll intentionally take time for yourself.
- When you're not working, disconnect by turning off Slack and closing down your email client. At GitLab, this only works if all team members abide by the communication guidelines.
- Enable the "working hours" feature on your calendar so that team members in other time zones know not to schedule meetings during times when you're not working.

### Communicate clearly
- Remote teams are less likely to know what's going on in each other's daily lives, so it's important that you're able to express yourself and ask for help when you need it.
- Make the most of your video calls so that you can build relationships with your team.

### Decide where to work
- Designate a space that's used solely for work so that you can mentally switch from home to office. Don't have a separate room to use as an office? Consider using a screen or partition to physically divide the space.
- Make sure you have the equipment you need to be productive (for GitLab team members, here's a helpful guide).
- Join a coworking space or meet up with someone else who works remotely to cowork in person.
- Try out different background sounds like music, ambient noise, or silence to see what works best for you while you're working.
- If you have family or roommates at home while you're working, consider setting boundaries with them about your workspace to reduce interruptions.

### Dedicate time for health and fitness
It's sometimes hard to remember to stay active when you work from home. Here are some tips that might help:

- Try to step away from your computer and stretch your body every hour.
- If possible, choose a workspace that's exposed to natural light.
- Avoid "Digital Eye Strain" by following the [20-20-20 Rule](https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/20-20-20-rule#definition). Every 20 minutes look into the distance (at least 20 feet/6 meters) for 20 seconds.
- Use an app - there are some that will remind you to take a break or help you with your computer posture.
- Move every day
  - Go for a walk or do a short excersise for at least 15 minutes a day.
  - Do something active that can be done within a short amount of time like rope jumping, lifting kettlebells, push-ups or sit-ups. It might also help to split the activity into multiple shorter sessions. You can use an app that helps you with the workout.
- Try to create a repeatable schedule that is consistent and try to make a habit out of it. Make sure you enjoy the activity.
- It can also help to create a goal or challenge for yourself, e.g. registering for a race.
- Eat less refined sugar and simple carbs, and eat complex carbs instead. Try to eat more vegetables. Don't go to the kitchen to eat something every 15 minutes (it’s a trap!). Keep junk food out of your house.
- Have a water bottle with you at your desk. You will be more inclined to drink if it's available at all times.
- Try to get enough sleep at night and take a nap during the day if you need one.
