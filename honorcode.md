# PRDXN Testing Honor Code:

All members of the PRDXN team are expected to strictly adhere to the PRDXN "Testing" Honor Code:

## During a test (or when answering questions designed to test my knowledge): 
- I will not engage in any activity that would dishonestly improve my test results. 
- I will not copy/paste answers from the Internet (unless I can explain, clearly, in my own words, WHY the solution I’ve “copied” (from the Internet) works).
- I will not copy/paste someone else's answer.
- If I can NOT answer the test question by myself (without help from the Internet or someone else) I will **not** partake in the test. 
  - *(Re: “Help from Internet”: If the test-taker can Google/find an answer (e.g. on StackOverflow or elsewhere) that helps them PROBLEM SOLVE, that’s fine. As long as the test-taker’s solution meets the test’s/evaluator’s expectations AND the test-taker can clearly explain, in their own words, WHY the solution they’ve used works.)*
- I will not give my answer to someone else. In other words, I will not negatively impact the education of someone else. 

## Post a test (or when answering questions designed to test my knowledge): 
- If I could NOT answer the test question by myself, I will ask someone who could, to help me.
- If someone needs my help to answer the test question, or explain the correct test answer, I will schedule some time to help them.
