# Salaries
- Salaries are paid within the first working week of each month either through direct debit or by cheque.
- During your first month of employment HR will encourage you to open a ‘Company Salary Account’ with HDFC. An appointment will be organized when you join.
- Any issues regarding your salary payment and/or compensation structure should be discussed with HR. HR will ensure that this conversation gets directed through the appropriate channels.
